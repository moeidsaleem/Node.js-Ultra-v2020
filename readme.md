## Souqalmal Challenge - Backend 

The challenge involved creating a node.js backend for a simple CRUD with Authentication project.
As for my experience, I could have handled this project with serverless approach for faster development or I could have completed a very powerful Access management control based API that is highly flexible in terms of scaleablity. 

I have completed many projects in the past and I wanted to put it all as technology has changed very fast and this is my most advance approach to handle a backend i 2019, using the latest technologies. The project is mainly based on an approach very latest and powerful,however i had done many tweaks to the architecture. 

I can improve the code even more and write proper unit test for each case however due to time based constraints, I have to deliver it as soon.
